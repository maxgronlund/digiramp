Artist and Company each declares that EACH HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE SIGNING THIS CONTRACT TO READ THIS CONTRACT CAREFULLY AND TO DISCUSS THE EXACT PROVISIONS OF THIS CONTRACT WITH ADVISORS WHO UNDERSTAND THE RECORD INDUSTRY GENERALLY, AND THIS TYPE OF RECORDING CON TRACT SPECIFICALLY.30.  DATE:  This agreement is effective as of: 							.COMPANY:						ARTIST:						Address:						Phone:						Social Security No:					BY:						SIGNER's Capacity:					ARTIST:						Address:						Phone:						Social Security No:					EXHIBIT "G" - FOR GROUPS1.  FORM CONTRACT. The form contract, including exhibits, if any, has been prepared for use primarily where the ARTIST is a single person.2.  PURPOSE. The purpose of this exhibit "G" is to set forth some provisions which are applicable in this instance because the ARTIST is composed of more than one person.3.  EACH PERSON BOUND. Each such person shall be bound by every provision of the entire contract, and shall hereinafter be referred to as MEMBER OF THE GROUP, or as MEMBER.4.  ROYALTY DIVIDING. The royalties payable to ARTIST are the total royalties to be paid by COMPANY. COMPANY shall pay each MEMBER the fol lowing share of total royalties:a.  If there are two (2) members of a group, each member gets 1/2 of the royalties.b.  If there are three (3) members of a group, each member gets 1/3 of the royalties.c.  If there are four (4) members of a group, each member gets 1/4 of the royalties, etc.5.  SHARES. COMPANY may at its discretion record less than all members of the group. Where such song(s) is released under the group name, then all members constituting the group on the day of the recording shall share in the royalties, whether or not all members took part in the recording session. However, where such song is not released under the group name, then such song shall not apply to be counted toward the "minimum number of selections" to be recorded by COMPANY during each recording period, and only such MEMBERS who took actual part at the recording session shall share in the royalties.a.  EXAMPLE. For example, a group consists of two members. COMPANY records only one on a song, but releases the song in the name of the group. Each MEMBER is entitled to one-half of the royalties.b.  EXAMPLE. For another example, a group consists of two members. COMPANY records only one on a song, and releases the song under a name other than a name already used by the group or under which the record company releases group songs. Then only the member who actually recorded the song is entitled to royalties payable by COMPANY, and his share is 100% of the royalties payable.6.  BACKGROUND. Where one or more members of the group are hired as background vocalists or musicians, and the record label gives supporting credit to another Artist, then no royalties shall be paid to such members.7.  DISPUTES. In the event of any royalty disputes whatsoever involving incoming, outgoing, current, former, future members of the group, COMPANY may at its discretion make or withhold royalty payments from the date COMPANY is notified of such dispute until the date COMPANY receives written notice signed by all concerned that the dispute has been settled. The royalties withheld shall be paid into a bank account set up by COMPANY in the City of 				, or shall be paid into Court, at the discretion of COMPANY.8.  MEMBERSHIP. Membership in the group may not be changed without prior COMPANY approval. COMPANY may withhold approval at its sole and arbitrary discretion, and hereby notifies all concerned that it will probably withhold approval unless artistically satisfied that the change will not change the group sound, and outgoing members have made agreements concerning royalties, and incoming members have made agreements concerning this contract, and such agreements are agreeable to COMPANY.9.  TERMINATION. In the event that membership in the group is changed without prior approval of COMPANY, COMPANY may attempt to make adjustments caused by the change, or COMPANY may terminate this agreement.	In the event COMPANY terminates this agreement, COMPANY may then sign one or more agreements with one or more members of the group or persons not members of the group at the time of termination. COMPANY may make agreements with some, and fail to make agreements with other persons constituting the group at the time of termination.	One of the purposes of this paragraph concerning termination of this agreement and the signing of another agreement (which may be identical to or different from this agreement) is to enable COMPANY and members concerned to continue working together without the fear of possible disputes concerning royalties.10.  CONTINUED ROYALTIES. Unless a later agreement provides to the contrary, if COMPANY approved the member's leaving the group, the member shall continue to receive his share of royalties on masters cut before the member ceased to belong to the group and on which he was entitled to receive royalties.11.  PRE-MEMBERSHIP MASTERS. Unless a later agreement provides to the contrary, a new member shall not be entitled to share royalties on songs cut before the member belonged to the group, even though the first record release of such song may have been after such new member joined the group.12.  DISPUTE. In the event there is a dispute as to when a record was cut, the decision of the record company shall be final.  It is anticipated that disputes may arise in the event the song was cut at more than one session.13.  SHARES. The share of each member of the group shall be equal to the share of each other member on each specific record among the members of the group entitled to share royalties on the specific record. This shall be so even though the role of one (such as leader, or soloist, etc.) may have been far more important than the share of another member.14.  GROUP NAME. Each ARTIST hereby assigns any and all rights he may have in the group name to COMPANY. Each ARTIST agrees that he will not in any way use the group name after he is no longer with the group. Each ARTIST acknowledges that the fictitious name belongs to COMPANY.READ AND AGREED TO AND SIGNED AT THE SAME TIME AND PLACE THAT EACH RESPECTIVE PARTY SIGNED THE OTHER PORTIONS OF THIS CONTRACT.COMPANY:BY:						ARTIST (S)                                             MEMBERS OF THE GROUP:Names                                    Addresses (City, State, & Zips)                     Telephones            SSI#'s
